# 🎤 Braccio Arm — Voice-Controlled Robotic Arm

This project controls the **Tinkerkit Braccio robotic arm using voice commands**.  
Spoken instructions are processed and converted into movement actions, enabling hands-free control of a robotic arm through **Arduino-based servo actuation**.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Listens for predefined **voice commands**
- Converts speech → text → action mapping
- Sends instructions to Arduino to control the Braccio servos
- Supports motions like:
  - Up / down
  - Left / right
  - Gripper open / close
  - Pick and place sequences
